/**
 * Figures out how many keys you need for each check in a dungeon.
 * This is a bit complex unfortunately :(
 *
 * The way this works is for every dungeon:
 * - Assuming you have all items (including small and boss keys), you can reach all dungeon checks
 * - If the small keys are known to be in the dungeon, then at least one key must be in the first
 *   checks that are reachable with all items but no keys
 * - The next key must be in all checks that are reachable assuming you got the first small key
 * - Repeat until we know which checks you must access to be guaranteed to find X small keys
 * - Then all checks that are reachable with all small keys can contain the boss key, if it's known
 *   to be in the dungeon.
 *
 * The reason this is not universally true is that this is not how keys are restricted in rando:
 * - Rando instead says "all small keys and all boss keys must be in the Dungeon Name\Main area",
 *   which excludes boss checks. But theoretically there could be a future option that allows
 *   small keys behind the boss door. In that case the function would need to be tweaked to
 *   assume you have the boss key too when figuring out small key logic, but this can't be done
 *   right now as it would cause key logic to assume small keys can be behind the boss door.
 *
 * The correct thing to do here when rando logic becomes more complex is:
 * - Find a way to put the placement restrictions in the logic dump
 * - Assume you have the boss key when figuring out small key logic
 * - Use the placement restrictions to know whether there are small keys behind the boss door.
 *
 * Update: This still won't work in the interesting cases. E.g. Ancient Cistern, boss door
 * reachable with 0 small keys, but Chest in Key Locked Room needs 2 keys. Semilogic figures out
 * that the small keys could be behind the boss door, which means that it can't assume that you
 * can open Chest in Key Locked Room, which could contain the boss key, so it can't assume that
 * you can get the small keys.
 * So you just don't get key semilogic and this needs a new form of reasoning.
